# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os, is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.


### About this project
Making a Tic-Tac-Toe game is the first project in software engineering immersive course of GA (General Assembly) Sydney.


### How can play this
1. Press the 'Player1 VS. Player2' button.

2. Enter your names and then click the 'Submit' button. (note: there is a random function which show us who is the first player.)

### Through the code


#### <ins>html</ins>

I made three `div`s for each page. In each page, some of the `div`s are hidden for another pages.

#### <ins>JavaScript</ins>

I made two JavaScript files, *DOM(MB).js* and *Gamejs(MB).js*. The DOM(MB) is for working with DOM by using jQuery library and the other one for working like behind the scenes.

* <ins>Gamejs(MB).js</ins> : i made an object named gameObj which can make the matrix shape of three row arrays. there is a function which can choose who is going to be the first player by simple `Math.random()` function. There is one key named memory, which can save the numbers which has been chosen by players. And there is one key named *playingRounds* which deals with the rounds and how to figure out is there any winner or the game has been tied.

* <ins>DOM(MB).js</ins> : At first i made one function which used to render the game. At the second page, i used some jQuery functions like `fadeIn()` `fadeOut` `delay` `clone()` and others to make animations.
